      <p>
        Iwatayama Monkey Park (Japanese: 嵐山モンキーパーク, Arashiyama Monkī
        Pāku) is a commercial park located in Arashiyama in Kyoto, Japan. The
        park is on Mt Arashiyama, on the opposite side of the Ōi River as the
        train station. It is inhabited by a troop of over 170 Japanese macaque
        monkeys. The animals are wild but can be fed food purchased at the site.

      <h2>Fushimi Inari Shrine</h2>
      <p>
        Fushimi Inari Shrine (伏見稲荷大社, Fushimi Inari Taisha) is an
        important Shinto shrine in southern Kyoto. It is famous for its
        thousands of vermilion torii gates, which straddle a network of trails
        behind its main buildings. The trails lead into the wooded forest of the
        sacred Mount Inari, which stands at 233 meters and belongs to the shrine
        grounds. Fushimi Inari is the most important of several thousands of
        shrines dedicated to Inari, the Shinto god of rice. Foxes are thought to
        be Inari's messengers, resulting in many fox statues across the shrine
        grounds.

      <h2>Osaka Prefecture</h2>
      <p>
        Osaka is a large port city and commercial center on the Japanese island
        of Honshu. It's known for its modern architecture, nightlife and hearty
        street food. The 16th-century shogunate Osaka Castle, which has
        undergone several restorations, is its main historical landmark. It's
        surrounded by a moat and park with plum, peach and cherry-blossom trees.
        Sumiyoshi-taisha is among Japan’s oldest Shinto shrines.

      <h2>Genbaku Dome</h2>
      <p>
        The Hiroshima Peace Memorial (Genbaku Dome) was the only structure left
        standing in the area where the first atomic bomb exploded on 6 August
        1945. Through the efforts of many people, including those of the city of
        Hiroshima, it has been preserved in the same state as immediately after
        the bombing. Not only is it a stark and powerful symbol of the most
        destructive force ever created by humankind; it also expresses the hope
        for world peace and the ultimate elimination of all nuclear weapons.

      <h2>Itsukushima Shrine</h2>
      <p>
        The shrine has more than 1400 years of history, and is a registered
        World Heritage Site. The vermillion lacquered shrine, located at the
        beautiful Itsukushima, fits well with the Prussian blue sea, and the
        green of the virgin forest, recreating the elegance of the Heian era.
        Many visitors from all around the world continue to visit.

      <h2>Kobe Harborland</h2>
      <p>
        Kobe Harborland is a shopping and entertainment district between JR Kobe
        Station and the waterfront of Kobe's port area. The district offers a
        large selection of shops, restaurants, cafes and other amusements,
        which, together with the romantic evening atmosphere, have made it a
        popular spot for couples and tourists alike. Kobe has been an important
        port city for many centuries. Its port was among the first to be opened
        to foreign trade in the 19th century alongside the ports of Yokohama,
        Nagasaki, Hakodate and Niigata.

      <h2>Shibuya Crossing</h2>
      <p>
        The sprawling scramble intersection just outside Shibuya Station is an
        embodiment of Tokyo itself: action in all directions. Three huge
        television screens mounted on the buildings facing the intersection
        flash all day, while the rest of the area is covered with lights,
        advertisements, and more lights. And that's just when you're looking up.
        Look down, and you'll see the most remarkable feature of the area: the
        people. People are constantly pouring across the street from all
        directions going to even other directions. They all meet in the middle
        in a frantic mess, bumping, side stepping and swerving around each other
        as they try to cross.
